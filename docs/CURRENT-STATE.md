# Remote Dispatch - Current State

This document describes **what the codebase actually does right now** (the "is"),
based on the local branch - 90 commits ahead of upstream `trunk` (1.7.0). It is a
snapshot, not a plan. For intended direction, see `docs/VISION.md` (if present).

- Branch: `trunk`, 90 commits ahead of `origin/trunk` (merge-base `f4c3f21`, "publish 1.7.0")
- Upstream: https://github.com/domroutley/dv-remote-dispatch
- Local remotes: `origin` (domroutley), `fork` (rassiMC)

> Breaking up the bigger picture: the stable, released features (cars, players,
> jobs, junctions, loco control, core signals readout) are inherited from
> upstream. The local commits are almost entirely **switchboard** work - a
> second-screen dispatch UI with occupancy, signal control, and block-level
> pathing/staging. That is the part of the codebase that is WIP and poorly
> documented; this file goes deepest there.

## 1. Big picture & runtime flow

The mod is a C# UnityModManager plugin for Derail Valley. It embeds a web
frontend (Leaflet + the `switchboard-*.js` modules), serves it over HTTP from
the game process, and pushes real-time updates over a tag/event mechanism.

```
Main.Load()                       # entry point (UnityModManager)
  -> OnToggle(on)  HttpServer.Start()  (HTTP on Main.settings.serverPort,
                                          default 7245)
  -> Updater.Create()             # coroutine-driven data loops
  -> CarUpdater.Start()           # train dirty-tracking + Harmony patches
  -> SignalsShim.Initialize()     # reflectively load Signals bridge (new or MP fork)
```

On disable (`OnToggle(off)`): `CarUpdater.Stop()`, `Updater.Destroy()`,
`HttpServer.Destroy()`, `SignalsShim.Teardown()`, clear occupancy mapping +
paths.

### Update / push architecture
- The backend runs a **session/tag** model (`Server/Sessions`). A browser polls
  `/updates/{sessionId}`; sessions carry an `AsyncSet` of *pending tags* plus a
  base set on connect.
- Code calls `Sessions.AddTag("...")` whenever something the frontend cares
  about changes. The next poll then returns only changed "tags" (each resolved
  to fresh JSON). 5-minute inactivity timeout per session.
- Known tag names: `cars`, `carsWithLocomotives`, `jobs`, `junctions`,
  `player`, `playerNull`, `signals`, `paths`, `occupancy`, `modconfig`.

### Updater coroutines (`Engine/Updater.cs`)
| coroutine                | interval       | does |
|--------------------------|----------------|------|
| `CheckPlayerTransformCoro` | 0.1s          | push player transform (`PlayerData`) |
| `CheckTrainsetsCoro`        | every frame   | mark moving trainsets dirty |
| `DeferredEventsCoro`        | every frame   | drain `RunOnMainThread` queue |
| `CheckOccupancyCoro`        | 0.5s          | recompute occupancy if mapping present, tag on change |
| `CheckStagingCoro`          | 0.5s          | advance path staging if `enablePathing` |

`Updater.RunOnMainThread()` is the standard mechanism for safely touching game
state from the HTTP thread.

### Stale / potentially-confusing things
- `switchboard/` at repo root (with `data.js`, `renderer.js`, `data/*.json`) is
  an **early prototype** superseded by `RemoteDispatch/frontend/switchboard-*.js`.
  It is not wired into the mod and is not an embedded resource. The hotfix
  layout sources live under `switchboard/data/` and are copied into
  `RemoteDispatch/frontend/` before release.
- The older static layouts (`RD_1.0.4/1.0.7/1.0.8.json`,
  `DoubbleTrack1.0_1.4.3.json`) and the root-level
  `DvMod.RemoteDispatch.frontend.RD_1.0.4.json` duplicate have been **removed**;
  `main.js` now loads the `ST_2.1-hotfix.json` / `DT_2.1-hotfix.json` files.
- `RemoteDispatch/RemoteDispatch.csproj` embeds the real frontend via
  `frontend.*` fully-qualified resource names.
- `AGENTS.md` mentions `RemoteDispatch.Tests/`, `RemoteDispatch.Signals.Tests/`,
  and a `.slnx`, but those are **not present** (no test projects exist; the
  solution is `RemoteDispatch.sln`).
- `TODO.txt` and `SWITCHBOARD_REDO_TODO.txt` are **stale** (they pre-date the
  block-based rework in `2dd3fa0`). `DESIGNREQUIREMENTS.md` is the original
  switchboard requirements sketch.
- There is **no automated test suite** in the repo.

## 4. Data flow detail

### 4.1 Occupancy (`Data/OccupancyData.cs`) - the core new feature
Two modes, frontend-controlled:

- **Direct mode** (default, `OccupancyMode.Direct = 1`): uses the Signals API
  `IsTrackOccupied(RailTrack)`. The frontend builds a "block ➜ junction
  entries" map and POSTs it to `/occupancy`; the backend caches it
  (`_blockJunctionMap`). Per block it walks tracks from the junctions to find
  which RailTracks the block spans, then checks physical occupation. This is
  the **release path**.
- **Hardcore mode** (`OccupancyMode.Hardcore = 0`): infers occupancy from
  **signal aspects** (`S1/S1r/S1c` = occupied, `S2/S4/S6` = clear) per junction
  port, respecting branch alignment. **Currently disabled / intentionally a
  fun extra ("gimmick"), not a supported mode.** Not needed for release; do not
  treat aspect-inference as a first-class feature.

Public members: `SetMode`, `SetBlockMapping`, `GetDetectedJunctionIds`,
`ClearMapping`, `GetOccupancyData`, `CheckChanged` (used by the updater),
`TryGetOwnSwitchIndex`, `GetSwitchBlocksForPath`, `GetOwnSwitchSignalIdsForBlock`,
`GetOccupancyJSON`.

### 4.2 Signals integration
Two-layer reflection chain (no compile-time dependency from the main mod):

```
RemoteDispatch (Shims/SignalsShim)
    --reflection--> RemoteDispatch.Signals.dll  (new fork: Bootstrap → SignalsBridge → Signals.Game)
    --reflection--> RemoteDispatch.SignalsMP.dll (old fork: Bootstrap → SignalsBridge → Signals.API)
```

- `SignalsShim.Initialize()` finds the `DVSignals` UMM mod. Two Signals mods share
  that Id, so it discriminates by **version string**: a `-mp` suffix
  (`1.1.3-mp` / `1.1.4-mp`, old fork with `Signals.API.dll`) loads
  `RemoteDispatch.SignalsMP.dll`; any other version (`1.0.0`, WhistleWiz rebuild
  with no API) loads `RemoteDispatch.Signals.dll`. If `Signals.API` is still in
  the AppDomain the API bridge is preferred as a fallback. It caches `MethodInfo`s
  for: `GetAllSignals`, `GetSignalAspect`, `SetSignalAspect`, `SetSignalMode`,
  `IsTrackOccupied`, `Teardown`.
- Both bridge DLLs expose the **same static surface**
  (`Bootstrap.Initialize/Teardown/GetAllSignals/GetSignalAspect/SetSignalAspect/
  SetSignalMode/IsTrackOccupied`) and both project signal data into the identical
  `Dictionary<string signalId, object>` shape (`Id`, `Type`, `Mode`,
  `CurrentAspectId`, `IsOn`, `Direction`, `JunctionId`, `RequiredBranch`,
  `SelectedBranch`, `YardId`, `TrackId`, `Position[x,z]`), so `SignalsShim` and
  the frontend are backend-agnostic. Both register event callbacks that push
  `Sessions.AddTag("signals")` on aspect/mode changes.
- Old-fork `SignalsBridge.cs` subscribes to `SignalsAPI.Loaded/Unloaded` + instance
  `SignalAspectChanged`/`SignalModeChanged`, and **force-updates** all signal
  aspects before every read (`ForceUpdateAllSignalAspects`, throttled to 5s), with
  a reflection `UpdateAspect` fallback over `Signals.Game` for API versions that
  lack `ForceUpdateAllSignals(bool)`.
- New-fork `SignalsBridge.cs` instead subscribes to the `SignalManager` static
  events (`AspectChanged`, `OperationModeChanged`, `OverrideChanged`) plus per-`Signal`
  events, and drives a throttled `Signal.UpdateAspect(false)` sweep for freshness.
  New-fork signal keys are the numeric **registry `Signal.Id`** (parity with
  upstream `b230c83`): entry signals often share display names like "A"/"B"
  across yards, and name-keying silently dropped them from `/signals`. The
  display name is now a separate `Name` projection field (also carried through
  `MinimalSignalData`, alongside `YardId`), which the frontend uses for marker
  titles/popups; `-mp` signal ids are unchanged (name-embedded). Signal ids are
  **per-run, not persistent** - `signalpacks/*.json` tables are keyed by the
  numeric id from the current session.
  `SignalOperationMode` is folded back to the legacy
  `Manual`/`Automatic` strings that the frontend and pathing code expect, and the
  new richer `SignalType` is folded back to the old `Mainline/IntoYard/Shunting/
  Distant/Other` names. Direct occupancy uses
  `RailTrackOnTrackBogiesExtensions.BogiesOnTrack` (public Assembly-CSharp helper
  the new mod's internal `HasBogies` wraps).
  - **Direction is the controller's facing semantic, not signal names.**
    The old fork's names carried a `{junctionId}:F/:B1/:B2` suffix that encoded
    junction + facing; the new fork's `Signal.Name` does not. The bridge reads
    `TrackSignalController.Direction` (set by the Signals mod at creation:
    junction signals = `Out`, branch signals = `In`) and maps it to
    `"Out"`/`"In"`. (Upstream's `signal.Controller == junctionController`
    comparison only ever matches the Out controller, so it classified branch
    controllers as `Out`; this fork deliberately keeps the placement-derived
    facing - upstream's switchboard doesn't attach In signals, so it never
    needed the branch case.) The owning junction is read off
    `controller.GroupJunction` on **every** controller so In/branch signals
    still carry a `JunctionId` (the switchboard depends on this), and for In
    signals the bridge additionally emits `RequiredBranch` (0 = left,
    1 = right) from the controller's **index in `Junction.outBranches`**
    (matched by `StartingTrack`), which matches the switchboard graph's
    left/right port assignment - the frontend uses it to assign `LeftIn`/
    `RightIn`. (The group's `BranchSignals` list can skip small tracks, so its
    index is *not* the port index.)
  - Both bridges guard `SetSignalAspect`/`SetSignalMode` with a **main-thread
    check** (thread id captured in `Register`); off-thread calls warn and no-op
    instead of touching Unity state.

### 4.3 Junction graph (`Data/RailTracks.cs → Junctions`)
`BuildTrackGraph()` derives a **junction graph** from `RailTrackRegistry` each
time it's requested (cached JSON). Per junction: `junctionIndex`,
`position` (lat/lon), `incomingTracks`, `outgoingTracks`, `currentBranch`,
`neighbors`, `degree`, and `commonNeighbor` / `leftNeighbor` / `rightNeighbor`
(port-neighbor mapping via `TraceToJunctions`, matching track endpoints by
**position proximity**: endpoints are grouped by exact `Vector2`, and the walk
collects every group within the `CONNECTION_THRESHOLD` (1.5f) of a point).
**`neighbors` is capped at degree 3** (the physical switch limit): in dense
double-track areas such as the DT-SJX1 crossovers, parallel track endpoints sit
close enough that `TraceToJunctions` links a spurious fourth continuation,
which would otherwise produce impossible junction signatures in `/graph`.
This graph feeds the frontend's switchboard mapping.

> Note: a stricter "only proximity-link junction-owned endpoints" change to
> `FindEndpointGroups` was tried and **reverted** - on DoubleTrack it collapsed
> ~300 junctions to degree 1 and effectively disconnected the graph. The
> proximity matching in the released code remains the plain
> within-`CONNECTION_THRESHOLD` version.

`GetInboundSignalMap()` / `BuildInboundSignalMap()` additionally matches
"orphaned" signals (those the Signals API doesn't tag with `JunctionId`) to a
junction by **spatial proximity** (25f threshold) to its outBranch tracks, so
branch-entry ("In") signals can be attributed to a junction.

### 4.4 Pathing & staging (backend)
- `PathingData` - in-memory `List<JObject>` of "path" entries. Each path has:
  `id` (`p{n}`), `blocks` (`JArray` of block ids), `startBlock`, `destBlock`,
  `switchAssignments` (blockId → branch 0/1), `signalIds`, `blockSignals`
  (blockId → signal id), plus `lookAhead` and an optional `note` (free text,
  preserved across path updates via `UpdatePathNote`). Paths are visible to the
  frontend via `/path` GET and enriched with per-block `blockStates` from
  `StagingData`.
  CRUD: `AddPath`, `RemovePath`, `UpdatePath`, `RemovePrefixFromPath`,
  `RemovePathFromStoredList`, `ClearPaths`, `UpdatePathNote`.
- `StagingData` - the **route-claim engine**. Models each path's progress as
  `PathStaging { blocks[], currentBlockIndex, lookAhead, status }` and keeps
  per-block queues (`_blockQueues`, pathId per block) plus `_activeBlocks`
  (blockId → claiming pathId) and per-path `_retryTimes`.
  `Process()` runs every 0.5s while pathing is enabled:
  - advances the current block when the *next* block is **claimed by this path**
    **and** becomes occupied (an unclaimed-but-occupied next block is a hint to
    claim it, not to advance),
  - prunes already-traversed blocks (removing them from the stored path too),
  - runs the **single advancing function** (`Advance`, StagingData.cs:426) for
    every active path. `Advance` is the one entry point for all claiming: it
    detects train movement, ensures the train's own block is claimed (the seed,
    refusing to steal it from another active path), and extends the lookahead
    window **conflict-aware** via `TryClaimFrom`/`CalcRange`. It is called from
    the periodic `Process()` check, from path creation/restore (the **startup
    check**: `AddPath` and `InitializeFromPaths` run `Advance` once
    synchronously so a new path's seed *and* lookahead window are claimed
    immediately, not on the next tick), from route extension (`UpdatePath`),
    and from a **growing** lookahead (`SetLookAhead`, the `+` button).
    Restoring existing paths (page reload / pathing re-activation via
    `InitializeFromPaths`) **preserves the live staging state**: already-tracked
    paths keep their claims as they were, and only genuinely new paths get the
    startup `Advance`.
  Claims are gated by `CalcRange`, which walks the route ahead and refuses to
  claim more than the range until all **opposing / upcoming** paths share the
  section have ended (`IsOpposing` detects reverse-direction travellers over a
  shared span). Non-opposing paths dequeue as they pass through; physical
  occupancy blocks a claim only for that block (walk continues past it).
  The **5s pacing timer** (`ClaimInterval` on `_retryTimes`) only paces the
  ordinary automatic extension so it does not all happen at once. The per-path
  **`lookAhead` value bounds the window** (default 5, set by the sidebar `+`/`-`
  stepper; `0` claims nothing ahead): auto-extension claims up to `lookAhead`
  blocks and the train-advance extension re-fills to it, with no hard upper cap
  beyond the route length. A train **advancing** onto the next block, a detected
  conflict probe (`conflictingAhead`, only within the lookahead window), or a
  **growing** lookahead (`+`, which clears the timer and claims synchronously)
  run **immediately**, bypassing the timer; conflict probes do not refresh the
  timer, so a path whose opposing traffic clears is never locked out for a full
  interval. The `-` button only **lowers the threshold** at which *new* blocks
  are claimed - it never releases already-held claims (those stay until the
  train passes them); removing a clearance is done by the **delete button's
  first press**, which calls `UnclaimPath` (`POST /path/{id}/unclaim`): it
  releases every claim the path holds (guard signals revert to stop) and sets
  its `lookAhead` to 0 so it does not reclaim itself, leaving the path active
  and re-clearable with the `+` button; a second delete press removes it.
  The **initial claim** of a new/restored path is deliberately **one section
  ahead only** (`Advance(staging, claimCap: 1)` from `AddPath` /
  `InitializeFromPaths`) - the rest of the window is filled by the 5s cooldown
  instead of being blasted at creation.
  Each `ActivateBlock` sets the block's guard signal to **Automatic** and throws
  its switch to the needed branch (`junction.Switch(REGULAR)`); releasing sets
  the signal back to **Manual+S1**.
  States exposed per block: `occupied`, `claimed`, `waiting`, `unclaimed`,
  `completed`.
  - **All Unity-touching mutations run on the main thread.** `ActivateBlock`
    mutates Unity objects (`junction.Switch`, DVSignals `ChangeOperationMode`/
    `ChangeAspect`), so every HTTP-triggered entry point - `POST /path`
    (`AddPath`), `PATCH /path/{id}` (`UpdatePath`), `PATCH /path/{id}/lookahead`
    (`SetLookAhead`, which can release/claim blocks), `POST /path/{id}/unclaim`
    (`UnclaimPath`, which releases claims), `DELETE /path`
    (`ClearPaths`/`RemovePath` + `RevertRouteSignals`) and `/signal/control`
    (`SetSignalMode`/`SetSignalAspect`) - now `await Updater.RunOnMainThread(...)`
    before touching the staging/pathing state (matching the activation endpoint).
    The `Process()`
    staging loop already runs on the main thread via `CheckStagingCoro`. This
    fixed a game freeze when setting a path: `AddPath` used to run `Junction.Switch`
    from the HTTP threadpool thread while the main thread waited on the staging
    lock.
  - **Lock ordering is `lockObj` → `paths` (never the reverse).**
    `PathingData.GetPathsJson` used to take the `paths` lock then
    `StagingData.GetStagingData` (which takes `lockObj`), while the main-thread
    `Process()` holds `lockObj` then takes `paths` via `PathingData.GetPaths` -
    a classic deadlock pair. `GetPathsJson` now snapshots staging data *before*
    acquiring the `paths` lock, so both threads acquire the locks in the same
    order.
- `PathingActivation` - `ActivatePathingMode()` sweeps all signals: any with a
  junction the pathing mapping detected go **Manual+S1** (so the dispatcher is
  in control), everything else (non-distant) returns to **Automatic**.
  (Turning undetected signals - e.g. the #ROAD yard signals - fully **off**
  via `SignalsAPI.TurnOffSignal` was considered but dropped: the API leaves
  `Operation` in Automatic, so the next update re-lights them into a manual
  S1c "Expect caution + dispatch control lamp" state. Needs a Signals mod fix
  first; see §7.1.)
   `DeactivatePathingMode()` is the clean teardown: it releases staging claims
   (`StagingData.ClearAll()`, which reverts each claimed block's guard signal to
   Manual+S1 while stored paths still exist), clears stored paths, then sweeps
   every non-distant signal back to **Automatic** (paced, see below) and pushes a
   `signals` tag. It is called when the `enablePathing` flag is toggled off (on the
   main thread) and on mod disable. `RevertRouteSignals` / `ClearRouteSignals`
   remain as per-path teardown helpers.
   - **Sweeps are paced across frames** (`PacedSignalSweep`, hosted on the
     `Updater` main-thread component): `ActivatePathingMode` /
     `SweepSignalsToAutomatic` collect a `List<Action>` of per-signal mutations and
     apply ~24 of them per frame instead of mutating the whole map in one frame -
     this removed the enable/disable game freeze (see §7.2 "No pathing freeze").
     `SetSignalToStop` additionally refuses to run against a Distant signal (they
     can't hold a stop aspect), so a future call site can never force one under
     Manual control.

## 5. Frontend (embedded web UI + switchboard)

Script load order in `index.html`: `leaflet`, `leaflet-sidebar-v2`,
`leaflet.zoomhome`, `tablesort`, then
`switchboard-data.js`, `switchboard-renderer.js`, `switchboard-mapper.js`,
`switchboard-signals.js`, `switchboard-occupation.js`, `switchboard-pathing.js`,
and finally `main.js?v=...` (cache-busted with a date).

### Global objects / responsibilities
| file | global | responsibility |
|------|--------|----------------|
| `switchboard-data.js` | `TrackData` | nodes/segments/blocks data model, JSON load/save (localStorage), block grouping (flood fill), switch adjacency/graph building |
| `switchboard-renderer.js` | `TrackRenderer` | Leaflet rendering of nodes, segments, switch blocks, signal dots; colouring by occupancy/pathing |
| `switchboard-mapper.js` | `SwitchboardMapper` | fetch `/graph`, build switchboard graph, `runParallelWalk` to map switchboard switches → ingame junctions (strict port matching + reciprocal crossover eviction, no degree fallback) |
| `switchboard-signals.js` | `SwitchboardSignals` | per-switch signal mapping, `VirtualSignal` forward/composition of aspects, lamp-based dot colouring |
| `switchboard-occupation.js` | `SwitchboardOccupancy` | occupancy mode (direct/hardcore) → POST `/occupancy` |
| `switchboard-pathing.js` | `PathingController` | interactive path select + A*-style block routing on frontend, then POST `/path`; displays locked paths, block chips, claim-ahead stepper + colour hue slider, delete/extend; colours claimed/waiting blocks |
| `main.js` | - | map set-up, sidebar tabs, jobs/cars tables, and switchboard bootstrap (`initSwitchboard`, `loadSampleTrackData`, `buildSwitchMapping`, `sendBlockOccupancyMapping`) |

### Switchboard view
- Toggled via **"Show Switchboard"** button → toggles `body.switchboard-active`
  and `#switchboard-view`; the map pane is swapped. The toggle is a purely
  cosmetic view swap - it keeps active pathing running in the background,
  still syncing `blockStates` and rendering to the hidden switchboard map, so
  returning to the board shows up-to-date paths.
- `#switchboard-map` uses `L.CRS.Simple` with
  `preferCanvas: true` (all existing `L.polyline`/`L.rectangle`/`L.circle`
  layers created without an explicit renderer adopt the map's canvas renderer;
  the original map with job/track overlays keeps its own `L.canvas()`).
  `TrackRenderer.coordsToLatLng(x, y) = L.latLng(y, x)` - i.e. switchboard
  "x/y" are treated as lng/lat directly (no fancy geographic projection).
- `loadSampleTrackData()` fetches `/modconfig` to learn `doubleTrack` +
  `enablePathing`, then loads the static layout JSON
  (`DT_2.1-hotfix.json` if DoubleTrack, else `ST_2.1-hotfix.json`) from
  `/res/`, runs `TrackData.fromJSON` → `groupIntoBlocks` → `renderAll`, and
  finally `buildSwitchMapping`.
- `buildSwitchMapping()` fetches the **live** `/graph`, builds the switchboard
  graph, runs the parallel-walk mapping from a hardcoded anchor
  (`SWITCHBOARD_ANCHOR = { switchboardId: 's1677', ingameJunctionIndex: 0 }`),
  prints unmapped switches/junctions + mapping-consistency violations, sends the
  block occupancy mapping to `/occupancy`, initializes signals, and enables
  `PathingController` if `enablePathing`.

### Switchboard mapping (switch ↔ ingame junction)
- The switchboard side is built by `TrackData.buildSwitchGraph()` (see
  `switchboard-data.js`), which walks from each switch port (merging/nl/nr)
  through connected tracks to its adjacent switch, recording both the *port
  being left* (`common`/`left`/`right`) and the *node of the target switch that
  is entered* (`entryNodeId` / `entryPort`: merging/nl/nr).
- The ingame side comes from the live `/graph` (see §4.3), which carries
  `commonNeighbor` / `leftNeighbor` / `rightNeighbor` per junction.
- `SwitchboardMapper.runParallelWalk()` maps the two graphs with a BFS from the
  anchor. For each visited switch it matches its switchboard neighbors in port
  order (**strict port match** first: the neighbor's port picks the ingame port
  target). If that target is already claimed, it checks whether the claimer
  shares a **reciprocal switchboard edge** with the neighbor being matched
  (`isReciprocalEdge`); if so, the imposter is **evicted** and the junction is
  re-assigned to the reciprocal leg. This is what fixes crossover / double-slip
  pairs (both legs of a switch collapse onto the same distant switch id, and a
  blind degree fallback would swap the two legs).
- There is **no degree/score fallback** any more: it re-claimed evicted
  junctions and re-swapped crossover legs.
- After the walk, `repairMapping()` runs a post-pass that re-scans the edges
  flagged by `validateMapping()` and swaps two graph-adjacent switches' junction
  assignments when the exchange strictly improves both switches' adjacency
  scores, iterating to a stable minimum. This corrects residual crossover
  leg-swaps that the BFS + eviction leaves behind (e.g. the MF J-632/J-546 and
  J-636/J-638 pairs) without regressing the reciprocal-eviction guarantees.
- `GRAPH_OVERRIDES` is now **empty** (all hardcoded junction overrides removed:
  the old J539–J542, J404/J403/J18/J370, and J125 entries were redundant against
  the live graph and deleted along with the earlier J26 fix).

### Switchboard signal dots
- Each switch draws a dot per port signal that has a real signal mapped: the
  inbound (common) port's `Out` signal plus the two branch ports' `LeftIn`/
  `RightIn` signals (`rawSignals` in `switchboard-signals.js`). Ports without a
  mapped signal fall back to neighbour-forwarding (`forwardMissingSignals`) and
  virtual signals; virtuals (`In`/`LeftOut`/`RightOut`) compose aspects but are
  not drawn as separate dots.
- **Dot colour comes from the lit lamps, not the aspect id.** A single aspect can
  light several lamps of different colours (e.g. a multi-aspect signal), so
  `SwitchboardSignals.signalDotColor(signal)` classifies every lamp lit by the
  signal's current aspect (from the `/signalpack` table: `entry.Aspects[aspect]
  .Lit` names matched against `entry.Lamps[i].Colour`) and picks the highest-
  precedence colour present: **red > blue > green > white > yellow**.
  `classifyLampColour` uses generous RGB-dominance thresholds (white = all
  channels ≥180; red = R≥150, G/B≤120; blue = B≥150, R/G≤120; green = G≥130,
  R/B≤140; else yellow). Blinking lamps are included in `Lit` (the backend folds
  `Blinking` into `Lit` at capture time), so a blinking green lamp still reads as
  green. When no pack data has been captured for a signal yet, the dot falls back
  to the old aspect-set mapping (S1/S1r/S1c → red, S6/S7 → yellow, S2/S4/S6 →
  green).
- Dots repaint through the coalesced repaint path: `updateAllSignals` calls
  `switchboardRepaint.markAllSwitches()` when any signal's aspect/mode changes,
  and `refreshPackTable` refreshes each marker's `.entry` reference when the pack
  table grows.

### Pathing UX (frontend)
- Backed by `PathingController`. To create a new path: start must be an
  *occupied* block; destination is any block that is path-reachable. A*
  over the block graph (built as "block nodes, edge via common junction/switch
  ports"). The chosen path is converted to `{blocks, switchAssignments,
  signalIds, blockSignals}` and POSTed to `/path`. The server assigns the path
  an id and seeding; the frontend keeps server-side `blockStates` in sync via
  `syncFromServer`, rendering colours via `TrackRenderer.resolveBlockColor`:
  each locked path has a stable random **blue-dominant** colour
  (`randomPathColor`); a block in one upcoming path shows that path's colour,
  a block in several shows the per-channel blend (`blendColor`), a **claimed**
  block shows the path colour boosted green (`claimColor`), and an **occupied**
  block is always red and wins over path colouring. Draft path-selection
  highlighting (start/dest hover) is transient UX with its own colours.
- **Waypoints** (right-click on a segment/switch while drafting) force the
  draft route through intermediate blocks: the draft is chained over
  `[start, ...waypoints, dest]` (`computePathWithWaypoints`, merging boundary
  blocks). Waypoints are draft-only - not sent to the server - and are cleared
  when the path is confirmed. Right-click on empty map cancels the draft. The
path search behind this (`computeBlockPath` → `_ensurePathTree`) is a
   per-source **memoized Dijkstra tree** that is invalidated whenever occupancy
   changes (`invalidatePathTree`), so edge costs stay current. The search is
   **two-tier**: a **valid** tier hard-blocks occupied through-blocks (source
   exempt) so a clear detour always wins over an occupied shortcut, and a
   **soft** tier (occupied-block penalty) is used only when the valid tier
   cannot reach the destination - so a dispatcher is never dead-ended while a
   clear route is still preferred (see §7.2 "Two-tier route search").
- **Extending a locked path** (⊕ button in the sidebar, `beginExtendPath`) is
  the **favoured way to grow a route**: the path's last block becomes the
  anchor, the same hover/A*/waypoint drafting draws a section from it, and
  confirming PATCHes the merged route (`extendPath` → `PATCH /path/{id}`),
  staying in extend mode so further sections chain on. Self-overlap is rejected
  (`extendPath` refuses a section that loops back through an existing block
  other than the anchor); staging conflicts with other paths are handled
  server-side by the claim engine. Esc / right-click cancels extend mode.
  Because extend keeps the route anchored and re-anchors at the new end each
  time, it is intended to replace the waypoint-driven *new path* flow as the
  primary routing UX.
- **Path notes**: each locked path has a sidebar note field ("locomotive /
  destination / note") saved via `PATCH /path/{id}/note`
  (`PathingData.UpdatePathNote`) and preserved across path updates.
- `PathingController` is armed by the `enablePathing` flag via the `modconfig`
  tag (not by the view toggle). Activation (`POST /pathing/activate`) is only
  sent once a real switch→junction mapping exists; if the flag is on before the
  switchboard is ever opened, `enableFromMapping()` fires the activation as soon
  as the board builds its mapping.
- The sidebar `#pathList` renders each locked path with block chips, a note
  field, a **− N +** **claim-ahead stepper** (`PATCH /path/{id}/lookahead`: the
  `+` grows the threshold and claims it immediately, skipping the 5s pacing
  timer; the `−` only lowers the threshold at which *new* blocks are claimed
  and never releases held claims), a **hue slider** for the path colour
  (`PATCH /path/{id}/color`,
  `PathingController._changePathHue` - rotates the hue of the path's colour,
  kept server-side in the `color` field so it survives reloads), a **two-stage
  delete** button (first press with claims calls `POST /path/{id}/unclaim` to
  pull the clearance and set `lookAhead` 0; second press deletes the path), and
  a ⊕ **extend** button. The row being extended is highlighted with
  a green border.

### Switchboard performance notes
- The switchboard map uses `preferCanvas: true` (§ "Switchboard view"), so all
  ~1.5–1.7k track segments + switches render to one canvas instead of thousands
  of SVG DOM nodes.
- Repaints are **coalesced** through `switchboardRepaint` (`main.js`): tag
  handlers (`occupancy`, `paths`, `signals`, `junctions`) mutate state and mark
  dirty blocks/switches; a single `requestAnimationFrame` pass renders the union
  once, and multiple tags in one poll (or consecutive 100ms polls) collapse into
  one pass. While the board is hidden (`!body.switchboard-active`) painting is
  skipped; the show-toggle full repaint catches up. The path-list sidebar DOM is
  only rebuilt when its signature (ids/blocks/`blockStates`) changes.
- Per-block colouring now reads a precomputed block → `{claimed,
  claimedPaths, upcomingCount, upcomingPaths}` table
  (`PathingController.rebuildPathStatusTable`, rebuilt once per paths sync)
  instead of scanning every locked path per segment, and
  `TrackData.getBlockForSegment` is O(1) via `_segmentBlockMap`.
  `renderSegment`/`rerenderBlocks` operate on `block.segmentIds`, so a changed
  block re-renders only its own segments. `randomPathColor`/`claimColor`/
  `blendColor` live in `TrackRenderer` and derive per-path colours from the
  table; the path's assigned colour is cached in `_pathColors` (persists across
  polls and reloads).
- Path searching (`PathingController.computeBlockPath`) is now a **memoized
  single-source shortest-path tree** (binary-heap Dijkstra computed once per
  start block); each hover target is an O(path length) trace-back from the
  cached parent-pointer map.

### Permission model (frontend-facing)
`Permissions` in `Settings.cs`: per-user toggles for junctions, loco control,
player blips, loco visibility, and **signal control** (`canControlSignals`).
`HasPathingPermission = HasJunctionPermission && HasSignalControlPermission`.
New users auto-provision from `defaultPermissions` on first session.

## 6. Signals module (separate DLL) detail

Two separate bridge DLLs ship inside the mod folder (neither is a UMM mod), both
loaded at runtime by `SignalsShim` (see §4.2) and exposing the same `Bootstrap`
public surface:

- `RemoteDispatch.SignalsMP.csproj` compiles to `RemoteDispatch.SignalsMP.dll`
  and depends on the **old fork's `Signals.API`** (pinned in `refs/`). Its
  `SignalsBridge`:
  - `ForceUpdateAllSignalAspects()` (5s throttle) so aspects update even when
    no player is near the signal.
  - Falls back from the preferred `SignalsAPI.ForceUpdateAllSignals(bool)` to a
    reflection walk over `Signals.Game.SignalManager` +
    `BasicSignalController.UpdateAspect`.
  - Guards `SetSignalAspect`/`SetSignalMode` against off-main-thread calls.
- `RemoteDispatch.Signals.csproj` compiles to `RemoteDispatch.Signals.dll` and
  depends on **the new fork's `Signals.Game`/`Signals.Common`** (from the
  installed `DVSignals` mod folder). Its `SignalsBridge`:
  - Subscribes to `SignalManager` static events (`AspectChanged`,
    `OperationModeChanged`, `OverrideChanged`) and per-`Signal` events.
  - Keys everything by the numeric `Signal.Id` registry key (parity with
    upstream `b230c83`); the display name is carried as a separate `Name`
    field, as is `YardId`. See §4.2.
  - Derives direction from the controller's facing
    `TrackSignalController.Direction` (junction signals = Out, branch signals =
    In; upstream's junction-controller comparison can't classify branch
    controllers), junction from `GroupJunction`, and the In-signal left/right
    port from the controller's `Junction.outBranches` index (emitted as
    `RequiredBranch`). See §4.2.
  - Guards `SetSignalAspect`/`SetSignalMode` against off-main-thread calls.
  - Folds `SignalOperationMode` back to `Manual`/`Automatic` and the richer
    `SignalType` back to the legacy `Mainline/IntoYard/Shunting/Distant/Other`.
  - Direct occupancy uses `RailTrackOnTrackBogiesExtensions.BogiesOnTrack`
    (public Assembly-CSharp helper wrapping the new mod's internal `HasBogies`).
  - `ForceUpdateAllSignalAspects()` runs a throttled `Signal.UpdateAspect(false)`
    sweep over `SignalManager.AllControllers`.

## 7. Known limits / WIP / rough edges (what's clearly unfinished)

Derived from reading the code; not a plan. The most fragile points:

### 7.1 Still open / not addressed

1. **Hardcore occupancy is a disabled WIP gimmick** (aspect-inferred occupancy).
   Not needed for release; Direct mode is the supported path.
2. **Frontend mapping is heuristic + hardcoded anchor**: `SwitchboardMapper`
   seeds the fit from `SWITCHBOARD_ANCHOR` (`s1677` → junction 0) with no
   coordinate-based ground truth, so residual mismatches remain possible. (The
   GF junction and the DoubleTrack crossover leg-swaps are fixed; the graph
   endpoint produces correct topology and junction `degree` is capped at 3.
   See §5.)
3. **Static switchboard layouts** are baked JSON files
   (`ST_2.1-hotfix.json` single-track, `DT_2.1-hotfix.json` DoubleTrack) - the
   board itself is *not* derived from the live game; only switch/junction
   mapping and occupancy are live. Layout edits require re-exporting these
   files (sources live under `switchboard/data/`), and `loadSampleTrackData` is
   hardcoded to those two filenames. The **Bravo Yard section is still
   misplaced** in the single-track layout and some Bravo switches plus the
   "Double track long switch near SW" are wrong in the DT layout
   (maintainer-owned, cosmetic).
4. **Turning off undetected signals** (e.g. the #ROAD yard signals) on pathing
   activation is **deferred**: `SignalsAPI.TurnOffSignal` sets
   `SetMode(Manual)` + `TurnOff()` but leaves the signal's `Operation` as
   Automatic, so on the next update it re-lights into the manual S1c "Expect
   caution" + dispatch-control-lamp state. Requires a Signals mod fix (set
   `SignalOperationMode.FullManual` inside `TurnOffSignal`); see §4.4.
5. **No tests.** Everything above is unverified by automated tests.
6. **Force-update hacks** in `SignalsBridge` depend on Signals internal types
   via reflection (`Signals.Game.SignalManager`, `BasicSignalController`) -
   brittle across Signals versions.
7. **Occupancy geometry cache** is built once at startup (`EnsureTrackCache`);
   a scene load can leave it stale (`ClearMapping` runs on teardown only). On
   hold - hasn't surfaced in practice; see VISION future plans.
8. **Residual signal suspects** (ignored for now per maintainer; see VISION
   future plans):
   - **DoubleTrack + Signals flip cancellation** (maintainer hypothesis,
     unconfirmed): the DoubleTrack mod and the Signals mod each mirror/flip
     signals on the second track, and the two flips cancel each other out for a
     subset of signals, leaving them with an inverted In/Out classification
     before RD ever reads them.
   - Signals whose controller isn't a `TrackSignalController` (e.g. Distant)
     have no switchboard facing, fall back to `Out`, and carry no junction so
     they never attach to a switch.
   - The `/signalpack` lamp table is built lazily, so an aspect that hasn't been
     captured yet falls back to the aspect-set colouring and can hide a
     mismatched signal.
9. **Multi-threading caution**: `StagingData`/`OccupancyData` are touched from
   the HTTP thread and the main-thread coroutines; the boundaries are easy to
   break. All HTTP-triggered Unity mutations are marshalled to the main thread
   and the `paths`/`lockObj` lock order is consistent (see §4.4).

### 7.2 Previously resolved

Fixed in this fork; kept as one-liners so the bugs are not reintroduced.

- **Two-tier route search**: the switchboard search hard-blocks occupied
  through-blocks (valid tier) and only falls back to an occupied-block penalty
  (soft tier) when no clear route reaches the destination, so a clear detour
  always wins and the dispatcher is never dead-ended.
- **Reload preserves claims**: `InitializeFromPaths` no longer clears
  `_activeBlocks` or blasts the lookahead window; already-tracked paths keep
  their claims and only genuinely new paths are seeded (startup check).
- **Advance is claim-gated**: the engine only moves a path's current block
  forward when the next block is claimed by this path *and* occupied; an
  unclaimed-but-occupied next block is a hint to claim it, not to advance.
- **Conflict-aware seeding**: new-path seeding routes through the claim engine
  (now the single `Advance`, §4.4) instead of an unguarded `ActivateBlock`; it
  refuses to steal the start block from another active path.
- **Initial claim vs opposing traffic**: `TryClaimFrom`'s old unconditional
  Case-2 claim is merged into the `CalcRange` walk, so a first extension claims
  only up to where opposing paths end (backing off on the retry otherwise).
- **Signal direction/ports**: In/Out facing comes from
  `TrackSignalController.Direction`, and the left/right port from the
  controller's `Junction.outBranches` index (`RequiredBranch`), not the group's
  `BranchSignals` list. See §4.2.
- **Signal identity**: new-fork signals are keyed by the unique per-run
  `Signal.Id` instead of the display `Name`, so identically-named signals across
  yards no longer overwrite each other in `/signals`.
- **No pathing freeze**: enabling/disabling pathing no longer freezes the game -
  full-map signal sweeps are paced across frames (`PacedSignalSweep`) and the
  pack-table flush is throttled (5s gate + catch-up write).
- **In-game manual signal control**: the "manual control doesn't apply to
  in-game clients" issue was a bug in the Signals mod, fixed there; no change
  was needed in Remote Dispatch.
- **Path-set freeze**: setting a path no longer freezes the game - all
  HTTP-triggered Unity mutations run via `Updater.RunOnMainThread` and the
  `paths`/`lockObj` lock order is consistent. See §4.4.
- **Lamp-based dot colours**: switchboard signal dots are coloured from the
  lamps actually lit by the current aspect (via `/signalpack`), not a
  single-aspect stop/caution/clear mapping.
- **Unified block colours**: `TrackRenderer.resolveBlockColor` is the single
  source of truth; occupied always reads as red and wins over path colouring.
- **Mapping fixes**: the GF junction that broke a station's mapping and the
  DoubleTrack crossover leg-swaps are fixed (position-proximity endpoint
  matching, junction `degree` capped at 3, reciprocal-edge eviction +
  `repairMapping()`); the mapping is a clean 641/641 bijection.
- **Clean disable/re-enable**: `PathingActivation.DeactivatePathingMode()`
  releases claims and reverts guard signals to Automatic; the map ⇄ switchboard
  view toggle keeps pathing running in the background.

### Release blockers (per maintainer, April 2026)

Known before a wide release; unless explicitly marked "owner = maintainer",
they are fair game for agent help:

1. **Path conflicts**: multi-train handling has no complete live-resolution.
   For the upcoming release the plan is to *prevent* conflicts outright rather
   than resolve them live; the conflict-aware claim engine (§4.4) already
   covers the initial claim, lookahead growth, and the first extension into
   opposing traffic. Live conflict *resolution* remains on hold. See VISION
   blocker #1.
2. A **new DoubleTrack mod version** is planned; it will need a new
   switchboard layout, but work can only start once the scope of that release
   is known (coordinated with the maintainer).
3. **Upstream signal-integration work is not finished.** Upstream
   (domroutley/dv-remote-dispatch) is still actively merging Signals work, and
   this fork's signal handling (bridges, `RequiredBranch`, pack capture,
   `/signalpack`) must stay in parity with it. Frequent checks of upstream
   progress and **parity merges** are required before release - do not assume
   the 1.7.0 merge-base is the final signal surface.
4. **Exhaustive testing of all currently available signal packs** is required
   before release: default pack plus every custom pack this fork should
   support, covering lamp capture (`/signalpack`), lit-lamp dot colouring,
   per-type stop-aspect configuration (Settings stop-aspect rows), and the
   pathing-mode sweeps - especially on DoubleTrack where the signal flip
   interaction (item 8 in §7.1) is suspected.

Softer / held: full UI polish is WIP but not blocking; Hardcore occupancy is
disabled and not blocking; everything else is on hold.

## 8. Supplemental notes for agents

- **Maintain the update-tag discipline**: if you add data that the frontend
  renders, push it via `Sessions.AddTag(...)` and add the resolver in
  `Session.GetUpdateForTag`, plus the tag name to `BaseTags`.
- **Don't touch game objects off the main thread.** Route mutating calls through
  `Updater.RunOnMainThread`.
- **Frontend resources are served from `frontend/` embedded at build time**
  (`RemoteDispatch.csproj`); edit there, not at repo root. Bump the `?v=`
  cache-buster in `index.html` when JS changes.
- Files marked *NEW* in §2 belong entirely to the local switchboard work; the
  rest came from upstream.
